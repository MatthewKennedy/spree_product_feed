# Spree Product Feed

## ToDo

- Organise the code to recognise a basic product (no variants), Vs. a product with variants and process each type with of product differently to get variants displayed in google correctly via ```<g:item_group_id>```.
- Set up a way to add fields to the 'required product type options' of the feed. For example, in clothing, gender and age are required fields, but they would not be given as selectable variant, an example would be a men's leather jacket would not have a selectable option for gender, yet google requires gender in the feed data.
- Move Product Feed Option into their own sidebar view.
- Set up code to output all product properties into feed data where presentation is set to ```product_feed_data```.
- Set up unique identifier type drop down.

## Required Fields

### Adding Product Specifc Data To Your Feed
If you have an item such as clothing that requires: ```<g:age_group>``` & ```<g:gender>``` to be passed into Google Merchant Feed, but do not wish to have these listed on your site as selectable variant options, you can add these to your product feed as follows.

In the example below we are adding ```<g:gender>``` to your product feed data.
- Form the admin visit **Properties** settings and click **New Property**.
- Add a new property using the following values: Name = ```Gender``` Presentation = ```product_feed_data```, click **Create**.
- Next edit your product and click the **Properties** tab form the sidebar options.
- Add a new property searchng for ```Gender``` and then enter the value ```Female```. 

This will add ```<g:gender>Female</g:gender>``` into your feed for the product and all of its variants.

### Adding Brand
Create a property Name = ```Brand``` Presentation = ```product_feed_data```, and this will be added to your feed data.

#### Unique Idetifier
You will notice that you have an option to add a unique identifier to the master product, and its variants. This is a requirement for most products passed into Google Merchant.
