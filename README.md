# Spree Product Feed

The Spree Product Feed extension allows you to connect your Spree store directly to Google Merchant Center and Facebook Catalog via a live RSS feed.

Additionally, your products can then be exported from Google Merchant Center across to Microsoft Merchant Center, giving you access to Bing Shopping, Yahoo Shopping and other partners of Microsoft Advertising.

### Enhanced Listings Ready

Spree Product Feed extension will automatically recognise a product with variants, take each variant and create new feed item grouped under the master product id.

This is great for building Enhanced Listings on Google Shopping and works perfectly with Facebook Catalog.

### Sale Price Built In

You can take full advantage of the sale price (compare_at_price) functionality built into Spree 4.2 creating sale offers on your Google Shopping listings.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_product_feed', github: 'matthewkennedy/spree_product_feed'
    ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler

    ```ruby
    bundle install
    ```

3. Copy & run migrations

    ```ruby
    bundle exec rails g spree_product_feed:install
    ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Usage

### Adding Products To Your Feed
Once the extension is installed, you will notice a new checkbox (**Add to product feed**) available in the **Edit Product / Details** section.

When the Add to product feed checkbox is checked, your product will be added to the RSS feed located at: ```yourstoredomain.com/products.rss```, this can then be submitted to your Google Merchant Centre and Facebook Catalog accounts.

### Adding Data To The Products In Your Feed

To add data to each item in your feed this extension takes full advantage of **Product Properties**. In the example below we are adding ```<g:gender>female</g:gender>``` to a product.

- Form the admin panel visit **Properties** settings and click **New Property**.
- Add a new property using the following values: Name = ```g:gender``` Presentation = ```product_feed```, click **Create**.
- Next, edit your product and click the **Properties** tab form the sidebar options.
- Add a new property by typing **g:** in the property field, this will search for your newly created property, select the property when it appears in the list, and then enter the value ```female``` and click **update**.

To increase productivity it is wise to create ```g:google_product_category```, ```g:condition```, ```g:brand```, ```g:product_type```, and then set these as a  **Prototype** for fast repeated use.

### Overriding The Default Title & Description

By default, this extension will use your product name for the ```<g:title>``` field, and the meta description for the ```<g:description>``` field.

If you wish to override these, you can easily do so by adding product properties ```<g:title>``` and ```<g:description>``` with the Presentations = ```product_feed```, as described above.

## Unique Identifiers
You will notice that you now have an option to add a unique identifier to the master product and its variants.

It is a minimum requirement for most products passed into Google Merchant Center to have a Barcode (GTIN), or a Manufactures Part Number (MPN), you can also set the type of unique identifier that you prefer to use, in the product and variant settings.

## Feed Examples

```shell
bundle

```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
