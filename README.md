# Spree Product Feed

Give your Spree store instant access to some of the best product advertising platforms available.

The Spree Product Feed extension allows you to connect your Spree store directly to Google Merchant Center and Facebook Catalog via a live RSS feed.

Additionally, your products can be indirectly imported from Google Merchant Center to Microsoft Advertising, giving you access to Bing Shopping, Yahoo Shopping and other partners of Microsoft Advertising.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_product_feed', github: 'matthewkennedy/spree_product_feed'
    ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler

    ```ruby
    bundle install
    ```

3. Copy & run migrations

    ```ruby
    bundle exec rails g spree_product_feed:install
    ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Instructions For Use

Once installed this extension allows you to add products to an RSS feed found at ```yourstoredomain.com/products.rss```, this can then be submitted to your Google Merchant Centre and Facebook Catalog accounts.


### Enhanced Listings

If you add a product with multiple variants to the feed, the extension will automatically recognise this, take each variant and create new feed item grouped under the master product id.

This is great for building Enhanced Listings on Google Shopping and works perfectly with Facebook Catalog.

### Adding Product Specific Data To Your Feed
If you have an item such as clothing that requires: ```<g:age_group>``` & ```<g:gender>``` to be passed into your Google Merchant Feed, you can add these to your product feed as follows.

In the example below we are adding ```<g:gender>``` to your product feed data.
- Form the admin visit **Properties** settings and click **New Property**.
- Add a new property using the following values: Name = ```Gender``` Presentation = ```product_feed_data```, click **Create**.
- Next, edit your product and click the **Properties** tab form the sidebar options.
- Add a new property searching for ```Gender``` and then enter the value ```Female```.


This will add ```<g:gender>Female</g:gender>``` into your feed for this product.

**NOTE:** There are two things to keep in mind when adding data to your feed using Product Properties.
- Ideally, you will want to un-check the **SHOW PROPERTY** option so that this Product Property does not get displayed on your store front.
- Product Specific date entered using Product Properties will be applied to all variants.

### Adding A Brand
Often a brand is required along with a Unique Identifier to get your product approved in Google Merchant Center.

You can achieve this by following the **Adding Product Specific Data** section above, but using the following: Name = ```Brand``` Presentation = ```product_feed_data```.

### Unique Identifier
You will notice that you now have an option to add a unique identifier to the master product and its variants.

It is a minimum requirement for most products passed into Google Merchant Center to have a Barcode (GTIN), or a Manufactures Part Number (MPN), you can set the type of unique identifier you prefer in the product and variant settings.

## ToDo's
- Set XML language based on current.store language (upcoming release of Spree 4.X)
- Add in sale price logic when this is part of the spree core.
- Write spec tests.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_product_feed/factories'
```
